              Like most midwesterners, I want to work hard and keep those I care

              How I became a UX Engineer is the result of years of following my
              ideals but never really taking my own passions into account.
              Technology, and especially how we interact with it, has always
              been something I've loved. I have been afforded a lot of privilege
              by just being here. And while I am incredibly lucky to be in that
              position, I also have an obligation to use my privilege for good
              and for others. That obligation follows me in everything I do.
